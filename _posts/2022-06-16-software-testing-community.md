I have a lot to thank the Software Testing Community for, you are all a really amazing bunch of human beings!

The community helps me to learn, challenges me, lifts my mood and even supports me when I'm looking for new opportunities. I've made friends, and been inspired. For this I'm very grateful.

So, what is out there, and how can you get involved?

## Association for Software Testing

> The Association for Software Testing (AST) is a professional organization for software testers. We strive to build a testing community that views the role of testing as skilled, relevant, and essential to the production of faster, better, and less expensive software products. We value a scientific approach to developing and evaluating techniques, processes, and tools. We believe that a self-aware, self-critical attitude is essential to understanding and assessing the impact of new ideas on the practice of testing.

Full disclosure, I am an AST member! I took advantage of their new "Pay what you can" model, and with this membership is really very accessible. AST have a Slack group, blog syndication for members and run CAST, [the Conference of the Association for Software Testing](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/).

## Ministry of Testing

> Our StoryWeâ€™ve come a long way from our modest beginnings in 2007. The long timers in our community will know that Ministry of Testing started out at The Software Testing Club. A humble forum that, over the years, grew into an amazing and thriving online community of testers. The Software Testing Club forum is now switched off, but our online community continues to grow and discuss all things testing on our shiny new forum [The Club](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/).

### Ministry of Testing Meetups

You can't get much more local testing community then the MoT meet-ups! They are a great way to meet Testers in your local area, and an amazing opportunity to present.

Many of the best in the industry started by presenting at meet-ups such as these, and they still often bring their talks to meet-ups first, to test their ideas and practice ahead of larger conferences.
