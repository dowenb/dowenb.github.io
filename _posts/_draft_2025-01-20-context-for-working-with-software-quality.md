I've recently been exploring what the differences are, between the role of a Quality Engineer, a role I'm currently inhabiting in my work at Ada Health, and other roles in Software Quality.

One of the realisations I had already, that probably isn't news to anyone who has worked multiple jobs in any role in technology, is that the way different roles actually work, the expectations and reality, is very different from company to company.

Where you work, makes a huge different to the opportunities you have to explore and execute on different parts of your job, different tools from your tool box you get to use.

You may already know this, especially if you work in software and especially if you work in quality, context matters. But what do I mean by context? And what do you mean by context?

In this post I will discuss a few key points that have mattered to me, and setting my context, in different companies and teams. Naturally your experience will be different, it must, your context was different, and it still is! But you might find some of what I say relatable, and I hope you find any of it useful.
