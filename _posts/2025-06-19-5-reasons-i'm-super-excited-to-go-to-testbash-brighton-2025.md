I'm super excited to be going to [hashtag#TestBash](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23testbash\&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) Brighton UK 2025! For some many reasons:

1. I'm speaking! I'm giving a talk about navigating a career in Quality Engineeirng
2. I'm an Ambassador! I've volenteered a few times before at TestBash, and
    it's a prvillage helping everyone get the most from their exprience.
3. I know I'm going to learn a bunch! This will be my 4th time going to 
   TestBash, and each and every time I never fail to learn a ton.
4. I'll make amazing new connections and pick up with old friends!
5. Brighton is beautiful and I'll get to visit for a second time.
