### Tester of The Day Interviews

Between 17th of August 2020 and 9th of December 2022 I ran a daily celebration of the testing community. While I closed nominations for new winners, I still love celebrating the community. So I'm reposting the interviews from some of the honoured winners of the award.

## Interview

### Where are you in your testing journey?

I’m an experienced test professional, of 20 years. However I’ve had a really massive reset recently. Having been self employed for a long time, and an independent contractor; after a series of physical and mental health issues, I’ve decided to focus on developing my career in other areas, towards mentoring, coaching and leadership. I’m now a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, working with a team of amazing technical people on a massive 5G project. I also get to dabble in my interests in security, and still love learning and sharing with regard to that.

### The best bug you have ever found?

I was able to tamper the URL with an HR/Personnel review system, so that any profile could be seen, regardless of whether the user was their direct report or not. Up to the most senior personnel in the organisation (which was Government/Military).

### Advice you would give to Testers?

Have patience, take time to observe, absorb and process the things you do. Be mindful that there is usually more than one route to success. If you are getting bored, then that’s a red flag. Find what excites you and keeps you creative.

### What does winning mean to you?

Supporting others in their work, sharing success, getting positive feedback but responding well to the less positive. Always being mindful of my health and that of others with regard to their work and success.
